On January 15th, 2024 at around 2:30 PM, a pipe burst in the bathroom ceiling of my apartment at 123 Oak Street, Apt 2B, San Francisco, CA 94102. Water started leaking through the ceiling into the living room below, causing significant damage to the ceiling drywall and paint. The water also damaged the light fixture. I immediately called a plumber who fixed the pipe, but the ceiling damage is extensive. The water stains cover approximately 4 square feet and the drywall is sagging. I estimate the repair cost to be around $2,500 based on a preliminary quote from a contractor.
