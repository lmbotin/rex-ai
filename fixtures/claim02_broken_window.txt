Yesterday afternoon, a baseball from the kids playing outside broke our living room window. The window is completely shattered and there's glass everywhere. This happened at our house on 456 Elm Avenue, Oakland. We need to get it replaced quickly for security reasons. I got a quote for $450 from a local glass company.
